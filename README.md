# blockchain

This is my first implementation of a simple blockchain using the programming language Go, both of which I'm using for the first time.
This project involved creating a data model with indexes recording the position of the data in the blockchain, timestamps that 
automatically determine when the data was created, a record of pulse rate or beats per minute, a hash or SHA256 identifier representing
the data record, and a previous hash or SHA256 identifier of the previous record in the chain. It also involved hashing and generating 
new blocks, block validation, creating a web server, and rendering the data to the client.
